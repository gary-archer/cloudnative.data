1. Deploy Wordpress resources without errors

2. Get ingress working

3. Get some data writing to /app/data on data-worker2

4. Update to use storageclassname blank
   Add a comment on what it means

5. Change naming - I don't like the app=wordpress label set against the MySQL component
   Perhaps use these labels:
   - wordpress-data
   - wordpress-app
