1. Get ingress working and browse to Wordpress home
   Where does the data go?
   Should it be on /app/data on data-worker2?

2. Update to use storageclassname blank
   Add a comment on what it means

3. Update naming of labels etc to these values, then re-test:
   - wordpress-data
   - wordpress-app
